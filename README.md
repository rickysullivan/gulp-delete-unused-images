## Contributing

I'm new to writing Gulp plugins, be gentle. If there's anything you find wrong with this, please help.

## Known Issues

- Using an image extension in a CSS class will result in a match and won't delete the image. The same happens using dot notation in JavaScript files  

    ```
    div.jpg { background-image: url('images/some-image.jpg'); }

    ---

    if (myObj.file.images.jpg) {
    //...
    }
    ```

- If multiple image files exists in subfolders that under the root directory, and the name is referenced in the source file. It won't delete any of the named files that match.  

    ```
    images/filename.jpg
    images/subfolder/filename.jpg

    ...

    <img src="images/subfolder/filename.jpg" alt="Some great file">
    ```
